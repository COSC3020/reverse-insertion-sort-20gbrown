# Reverse Insertion Sort

Consider the code for insertion sort we covered in class:

```javascript
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for(var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var val = arr[i];
    var j;
    for(j = i; j > 0 && arr[j-1] > val; j--) {
      arr[j] = arr[j-1];
    }
    arr[j] = val;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Change this function such that it works from the end of the array rather than
the beginning, `insertionSortReverse()` -- only the direction of
iterating over the elements is reversed, the array is still sorted the same way
(ascending). Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Average-Case Time Complexity of Insertion Sort

In the lectures, we covered that insertion sort has best-case time complexity of
$\Theta(n)$ and worst-case time complexity of $\Theta(n^2)$. What is the
average-case time complexity ($\Theta$)?

Hint: Think about what happens in each iteration of the loop, and how often the
loop is executed. Keep in mind that for asymptotic analysis we don't care about
constant factors.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is
most important -- you can easily find the answer, but you need to demonstrate
that you've understood the concept. Add your answer to this markdown file.

## Answer

The average-case time complexity of Insertion Sort is O(n^2). This is because in each iteration of the outer loop compares the current element, with the elements in the subarray to its left, and moves the elements to right to make space. Average case considers distribution of input data. From my knowledge of insertion sort this means that if the data is randomly distributed,  each element will be compared to rougly half of the elements in the subarry before returning to its correct position in the array. This means the average number of compares and swaps should be equal, so the average-case time complexity should be O(n^2). Knowing this about Insertion Sort we can infer that reverse insertion sort has the same time complexity. They both use similar logic and operations to sort the array.
